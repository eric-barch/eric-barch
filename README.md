# Hi, I'm Eric!

I graduated from the College of William & Mary in 2018 with degrees in Economics and Government. I thought I would end up in law school, and spent a few years working in the legal department of Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm in NYC. While there, I start using Excel and VBA to automate internal processes and quickly fell in love with programming. I just finished up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and am looking for my first software engineering job!

I love to dream up new ideas for products then build them from scratch. These repos give a good sense of the kind of thing I love to build:

- üåç [**Sphericle**](https://github.com/eric-barch/sphericle): Want to memorize a geographic location, but it's so niche that no one but you would ever bother to make a quiz for it? Sphericle lets you build and save your own custom geography quizzes using any location available on the Google Places and OpenStreetMap APIs.
- üÉè [**Fastcards**](https://github.com/eric-barch/fastcards): Automatically convert read text into language learning flashcards in Anki.
