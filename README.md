# Hi, I'm Eric!

I graduated from the College of William & Mary in 2018 with degrees in Economics and Government. I wanted to go to law school and spent a few years as a paralegal at a private equity firm in NYC. While there, I started using Excel and VBA to automate internal processes and quickly fell in love with programming. I decided to switch careers and applied to the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Now that I've finished my batch there, I'm looking for my first job as a software engineer!
