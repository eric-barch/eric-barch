# Hi, I'm Eric!

I graduated from the College of William & Mary in 2018 with degrees in Economics and Government. I wanted to go to law school and spent a few years as a paralegal at a private equity firm in NYC. While there, I started using VBA in Excel to automate internal processes and quickly fell in love with programming. I decided to switch careers and did a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Now I'm looking for a job as a software engineer!

- Things I can do: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, NextJS, React, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Tailwind
- Things I'm learning: Golang, Neovim
- Other interests: 📖 🎸 🎹 ⛷️ 🛫
